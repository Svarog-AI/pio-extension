// Session host for capability authoring: wraps one constructed agent
// session runtime BY REFERENCE and feeds its counters store from the single
// instance-scoped listener threaded through the construction seam.
//
// The listener is the sole event feed: it is minted here, passed as a
// sessionListener option (attached exactly once at construction by the
// seam), and routes events into instance-owned observation state. There is
// no other subscription site and no module-level mutable state.
//
// Token aggregation is local on purpose: the platform's usage-totals helper
// is not exported from the installed package root (deep-importing it is
// blocked by its exports map), and the stats accessor aggregates on a
// different channel that cannot supply per-run deltas. The local accumulator
// mirrors the platform's five-field additive rules, and the exposed token
// scalar applies the same derivation the platform uses for its own stats
// total.
//
// Phase running drives settled agent runs through the session's prompt
// channel: one awaited prompt settles a whole logical run (internal
// retries, compaction continuations, and queued messages all resolve inside
// it), so the prompt promise alone is the settlement authority. Settled-end
// payloads are appended to a flat monotonic master list tracked by a
// baseline number — reads are non-consuming slices stable within a window,
// explicit resets move only the baseline, and nothing ever truncates a list
// or the cumulative counters. The same idiom spans both the committed-path
// list and the payload list.
